This repository is the source code for a one-page static website that houses an index of all courses I have taught since 2014. (Note: some links point to closed systems such as Slack and Discord. Websites with "403 Forbidden" errors have likely been disabled via `.htaccess` on the web host.)

`make-website-toc.py` automatically generates the `index.html` file. See the file for instructions on adding a new course name, semester, and course.
